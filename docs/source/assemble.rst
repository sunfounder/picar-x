In this tutorial, you will learn:

* **Preparation**: We'll introduce you to all the tools and parts needed, ensuring you're fully equipped before starting the assembly.

* **Assembly Steps**: We'll demonstrate each assembly step in a systematic manner.

* **Tips and Considerations**: Throughout the process, we'll share essential tips and tricks to help you avoid common mistakes and ensure your car operates smoothly.

* **Zeroing a Servo**: Before fixing each servo, it needs to be zeroed first. The steps for zeroing are to first install the Raspberry Pi OS, then install the required modules, and then run a script (set the angle of all PWM pins to 0). After that, plug in the servo wire to zero the servo.
