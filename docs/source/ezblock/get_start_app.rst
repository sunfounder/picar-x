Install and Configure EzBlock Studio
=========================================

As soon as the robot is assembled, you will need to carry out some basic operations.

* :ref:`ezblock:install_ezblock_app_latest`: Download and install EzBlock Studio on your device or use the web-based version.
* :ref:`ezblock:connect_product_ezblock_latest`: Configure Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and calibrate before use.
* :ref:`ezblock:open_run_latest`: View or run the related example directly.

.. note::

    After you connect the Picar-x, there will be a calibration step. This is because of possible deviations in the installation process or limitations of the servos themselves, making some servo angles slightly tilted, so you can calibrate them in this step.
    
    But if you think the assembly is perfect and no calibration is needed, you can also skip this step.
